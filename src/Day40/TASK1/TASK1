Create a class called Animal
create methods called run(), makeSound() in Animal
create subclasses of Animal: Cat, Dog, Horse
override makeSound() in subclasses
-----------------------------------
inside Animal (Overload run method)
create run(int meters) method -> prints something like: Animal runs 4 meters
create run(int units, String unit) method -> prints something like: Animal runs 2 kilometers
-----------------------------------------
for run methods, instead of Animal use Cat Dog and Horse respectively, depending on who they are
