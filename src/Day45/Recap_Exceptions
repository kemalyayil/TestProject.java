error       we can't handle
checked     is on the compiler  (red underlined before running)
unchecked   is run time error   (we are not aware of the error before running)

we can create a custom exception , the only thing that we need to is to EXTEND it RUNTIMEEXCEPTION or EXCEPTION as parent/child.
to create a checked exception in methods we use "Throws" key word.

try
catch
finally   ==> bu oldugunda finally olani illa ki run edecek, catch olsa da olmasa da .
