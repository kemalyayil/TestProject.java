          Array VS ArrayList (interview Question)

    Major difference is that; Array is a fixed length data structure,
    so we can't change length of Array once created, ArrayList is resizable.

    The other major one is that Array can contain both primitives and objects.
    ArrayList can only contain objects. It cannot contain primitive types.

    Also, we can compare Array and ArrayList on how to calculate
    length of Array or size of ArrayList.
    We use length for an Array, we use size() method for an ArrayList.
